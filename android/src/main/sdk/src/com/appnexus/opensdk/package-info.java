 * To monetize a free app you may choose to include advertising.
 * Where, how, when and why are all up to you.  This SDK gives you,
 * the application developer, the ability to show ads.  It also gives
 * you complete control over where and when they will appear.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two basic types of advertisements: banners and
 * interstitials.  Banner ads occupy some part of the screen you
 * choose and within whichever views you choose.  Interstitial ads
 * take the whole screen: they are modal, they typically generate
 * larger revenue.  For example, they are typically used between game
 * levels, or when the application starts.
